# Subdomain Finder

This Python script implements a multithreaded subdomain finder using brute-forcing techniques. It's designed to be an intermediate-level project for those learning about threading and network programming.

**Features:**

- Checks for subdomains using a provided wordlist.
- Utilizes multithreading for improved performance.
- Handles potential network errors gracefully.
- Provides clear output of found subdomains.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x 
- `requests` library (install using `pip install requests`)

**Usage:**

1. Save the script as `subdomain_finder.py`.
2. Prepare a text file containing subdomains to check (e.g., "subdomains.txt").
3. Run the script from your terminal: `python subdomain_finder.py`

The script will prompt you for the target domain and the path to the subdomains wordlist. It will then scan for subdomains and print the found ones.

**Example:**
```
Enter target domain: google.com
Enter path to subdomains wordlist: wordlist.txt
[+] Found: admin.google.com

Found Subdomains:
admin.google.com

Execution time: 9.32 seconds
```

**Disclaimer:**

This script is for educational purposes only. Always use it responsibly and ethically. Do not scan targets without proper authorization.

**Further Enhancements:**

- Use a more comprehensive subdomains wordlist.
- Implement advanced thread management techniques (e.g., thread pool).
- Add options for output formatting (e.g., saving results to a file).
- Integrate with other tools and services for a more robust scanning solution.
